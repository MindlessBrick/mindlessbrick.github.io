Every now and then I encounter a problem which I cannot solve immediately. I keep a collection of these to return to sometime in the future when I have more time and knowledge. Some problems are from other sources and some are original problems posed by me.



1. Sum of two uniform random variables.

$$ X,Y iid Uniform[0,1].$$ Let $$Z=X+Y.$$
i. $$What is the variance of Z?$$
3. fefe
$$ 1 + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{4^2} + .... = \frac{\pi^2}{6} $$

$$ e^{i\theta}=\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta) $$
