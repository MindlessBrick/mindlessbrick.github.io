One of my old goals was to be able to memorise a deck of cards in under 60 seconds. Most people wouldn't believe that such a task is even possible, however it's suprisingly easy with a few simple techniques.

 - Card Mapping using the [Mnemonic Major System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system)
 - [Method of Loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci)
