It's time for me to start documenting my journey towards redeeming everything I've failed. I don't want to give up on things of the past. This website will be a nice side project which will also help keep me accountable.

I also hope it provides valuable information to any readers, whether it's random information which I found interesting or something greater, like the motivation to help you try to achieve your own past goals.
